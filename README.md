# learning-react
This is one of my small projects that I am making for the purpose of learning React. 
I am  making this app according to Pluralsight/Code School course Powering up with React by Sergio Cruz https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/code-school-powering-up-with-react/table-of-contents.
I have set it up as explained in official React documentation, Add React to a Website https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html
Feel free to check it out :)
